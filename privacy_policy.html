	<h1>Luftlinie Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>
	When you search for where you want to go, whatever you typed is sent to <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/">nominatim.openstreetmap.org</a>, a geocoding service hosted by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Quoted below is the part of their <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy#Data_we_receive_automatically">privacy policy</a> that is relevant to that service:
	</p>

	<div style="border-left: 4px solid silver; padding-left: 16px; margin-left: 16px;">
	<p>[&hellip;] we collect information about your browser or application and your interaction with our website, including (a) IP address, (b) browser and device type, (c) operating system, (d) referring web page, (e) the date and time of page visits, and (f) the pages accessed on our websites.</p>
	<p>Further we may operate user interaction tracking software that will generate additional records of user activity, for example Piwik.</p>
	<p>[&hellip;]</p>
	<p>These records are used or can be used in the following ways: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>in support of the operation of the services from a technical, security and planning point of view.</li>
		<li>as anonymised, summarised data for research and other purposes. Such data may be offered publicly via <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org">https://planet.openstreetmap.org</a> or other channels and used by 3rd parties.</li>
		<li>to improve the OpenStreetMap dataset. For example by analysing nominatim queries for missing addresses and postcodes and providing such data to the OSM community.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The data collected on the systems will be accessible by the system administrators and the appropriate OSMF working groups, for example the Data Working Group. No personal information or information that is linked to an individual will be released to third parties, except as required by law.</p>
	<p>IP addresses stored by Piwik are shortened to two bytes and detailed usage information is retained for 180 days. </p>
	<p>Given the temporary nature of this storage, it is generally not feasible for us to provide access to IP addresses or the logs associated with them. </p>
	<p>The above mentioned data is processed on a legitimate interest basis (see <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">GDPR article 6.1f</a> ). </p>
	</div>

	<p>That's all. The app does neither share your location nor any other data with anyone.</p>
